# ParZen Version 2
# WIP - Only basic recursion and referencing works so far.

A library for generating random well formated sentences from defined lists.

 * Supports Indefinite Article
 * Most pluralization, I still have work to do on Plural Possessives. 
 * Create and store variables for re-use from Randomly chosen words 
 * There are a few over writeable formatting functions that are baked in like
	* Full upper case
	* Upper case start of words
	* Upper case only the very first character
	* Pluralization based on context
	* Always pluralize
	* conditional pluralizations
